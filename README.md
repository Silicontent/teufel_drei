# Teufel Drei: The Third One

### TO PLAY THIS ADD-ON, ENABLE "Holiday Creator Features" WHEN CREATING A NEW WORLD!!!!!!

This is Teufel Drei: a Minecraft Bedrock add-on that changes most entities, recipes, and other things in Minecraft to cause the player as much pain as possible. However, there will always be a helping hand, hilt, or item to get you through the game and beyond. Before jumping in, remember: you will not have fun, you will not think this is fair, and you will not want to play alone. If possible, get a few friends with you before you get going. Trust me, you'll need them.

(final note: Teufel Vier is currently WIP. Check back later for potential updates)
