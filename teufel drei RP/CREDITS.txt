There are quite a lot of textures in Teufel Drei that I took from others on the Internet, as well as a few that are just color-swapped combinations of Minecraft's vanilla textures. Look, I was lazy and I suck at pixel art, okay? Anyways, this file contains all of the credits for each texture that I could remember. Thank you to all of the talented artists who created these textures!
