This is Teufel Drei: a Minecraft Bedrock add-on that changes most entities, recipes, and other things in Minecraft to cause the player as much pain as possible. However, there will always be a helping hand, hilt, or item to get you through the game and beyond. Before jumping in, remember: you will not have fun, you will not think this is fair, and you will not want to play alone. If possible, get a few friends with you before you get going. Trust me, you'll need them.

One thing to note is that this add-on is up on my GitHub page (https://github.com/Silicontent) for anyone to download and make changes to it. If you want to make *this* pack your starting point for a new add-on (for some reason), go right ahead. Just make sure that, if you modify and redistribute this pack, you give me credit for the original pack (and Microsoft I guess, but whatever). Also, in the resource pack folder is a list of credits for many of the textures you'll see in game. Make sure to read through those if you think a sprite in-game looks cool. But, I think that's enough of me now. If you don't care to learn about how this pack came to be, close this document now and get playing!


QUICK HISTORY
When I first heard of the ability to create add-ons for Bedrock quite a few years ago, I immediately downloaded the vanilla behavior pack and started messing with values. Eventually, I started adding in different behaviors to different enemies. This became the first version of the pain pack. I no longer have this version, but from what I remember, it was the worst, most unbalanced, unfair experience I've ever played. So, after a few play-tests with my friends, I got back to working on it.

Fast forward a year or two, and I have just remembered about this pack. I open it up and begin working on a bunch of new features, including a few custom items: the Obsidian armor. I also try to balance a lot of the mobs in the game to make the game a bit better. I give this second version of the Pain Pack a fitting name: Teufel Zwei (German for Demon/Devil Two). After all, it was the sequel to literal Satan. I still have this version on my computer, but it kinda sucks.

Now, move forward to a few weeks ago as of writing this (3/24/2023). I re-remembered the Pain Pack's existence and decide to double-down on fixing it. The third version of the Pain Pack, Teufel Drei, sought to actually help the player and make the experience bearable. With a boatload of new items and blocks, as well as many, MANY much needed mob balances, Teufel Drei is actually kind of fun to play, and is the current version I'm sitting on today.
